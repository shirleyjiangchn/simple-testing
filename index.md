# China’s Ideological Spectrum

The article “China’s Ideological Spectrum” by Jennifer Pan and Yiqing Xu is summarized here:

The study of ideology in authoritarian regimes—of how public preferences are configured and constrained—has received relatively little scholarly attention. This is because the arrangement of preferences is often seen as unimportant where individuals cannot vote or where votes do not meaningfully influence political outcomes. However, studying ideology in authoritarian regimes is valuable because it can shed light on the contours of opposition to and support for the regime. Using data from a large-scale online survey, we study ideology in China. 

We explore ideology in China mainly using data from the online survey zuobiao.me between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014, with 460,532 respondents attended. These researchers developed the 50 questions that were time-insensitive and covered a wide array of debates on key issues facing China. We group the 50 questions into seven categories: (1) political institutions, (2) individual freedom, (3) market economy, (4) capital and labor, (5) economic sovereignty and globalization, (6) nationalism, and (7) traditionalism. These categories represent areas where cleavages in public preferences, were they to exist, would most likely be found. The survey comprises of 50 statements with responses on a four-point scale—“strongly disagree,” “disagree,” “agree,” and “strongly agree” with no missing data allowed.
And in order to achieve better representativeness across geography and demographics, we construct a new sample of 10,000 observations using a resampling scheme, focusing on urban population, omitting provinces with few sample, approaching the real age and gender composition of china and so on. With this new sample, we conduct all subsequent analyses.
